# Student-Performance-Analysis-and-Classification
Project Overview
This project analyzes a dataset related to student applications, qualifications, attendance, and economic indicators to uncover insights and patterns. The goal is to provide a comprehensive understanding of the data and develop a classification model to predict student outcomes.

Visualizations
Distribution of the Target Variable: This plot shows the distribution of different classes in the target variable, providing insights into the balance of the dataset.


Correlation Heatmap of the Features: This heatmap highlights the relationships between different features, helping to identify which features are highly correlated and might be useful in a predictive model.


Distribution of Grades by Marital Status: This boxplot illustrates how students' previous qualification grades vary with their marital status, which could reveal interesting patterns in the data.


Unemployment Rate vs. Target Outcome: This boxplot demonstrates the relationship between the unemployment rate and the target outcome, showing how economic factors might influence the target variable.


Confusion Matrix of the Classification Model: This confusion matrix evaluates the performance of the classification model by showing the number of correct and incorrect predictions for each target class.
